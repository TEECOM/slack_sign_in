# Slack Sign-In for Rails

The goal of this gem is to get you up and running with Slack sign-ins:

  - with minimal configuration
  - as quickly as possible
  - without sacrificing on long-term stability and maintainability

The creation of this gem was heavily inspired by the awesome
[basecamp/google_sign_in](https://github.com/basecamp/google_sign_in) project,
both in its aspirations and in its implementation. If you need to add Google
sign-in to your Rails project, definitely check it out!
